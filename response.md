Math response: 
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this math problem step by step. The question is [(3 + 5) x (12 - 3 + 4) + 10] * 2. Hmm, I need to remember the order of operations here. Parentheses first, then exponents, multiplication and division from left to right, and addition and subtraction from left to right. Wait, but there are brackets and parentheses here. I think brackets are similar to parentheses, so I should start with the innermost ones.

First, let's look at the expression inside the outermost brackets: [(3 + 5) x (12 - 3 + 4) + 10]. Inside this, there are two parts: (3 + 5) and (12 - 3 + 4). Let me solve those first.

Starting with the first part: (3 + 5). That's straightforward. 3 plus 5 equals 8. Okay, so that simplifies to 8. Got that part.

Now the second part: (12 - 3 + 4). Hmm, here I need to do the operations from left to right since it's just subtraction and addition. Starting with 12 minus 3. That gives 9. Then, adding 4 to that result: 9 plus 4 is 13. So, (12 - 3 + 4) simplifies to 13.

Now, substituting those back into the original expression, we have [8 x 13 + 10]. Wait, let me make sure I didn't skip anything. The original expression after substituting is [(8) x (13) + 10]. Now, according to order of operations, I should do the multiplication before addition. So 8 multiplied by 13. Let me calculate that. 8 times 10 is 80, and 8 times 3 is 24, so adding those together gives 104. So, 8 x 13 = 104.

Now, adding the 10 to that result: 104 + 10 equals 114. So now the expression inside the brackets simplifies to 114. The entire original expression is now 114 multiplied by 2. Let me confirm once more to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

So, starting over:

Original expression: [(3 + 5) x (12 - 3 + 4) + 10] * 2

Step 1: Compute (3 + 5) = 8

Step 2: Compute (12 - 3 + 4). Let's break that down again: 12 - 3 is 9, then 9 + 4 is 13.

Step 3: Multiply the results of the two parentheses: 8 x 13. 8*10 is 80, 8*3 is 24, so 80+24=104

Step 4: Add 10 to that: 104 + 10 = 114

Step 5: Multiply by 2: 114 * 2

Hmm, 114 times 2. Let's do that. 100*2=200, 14*2=28, so adding those together is 200+28=228. 

Wait, let me verify each step again to ensure there's no mistake. Sometimes when doing mental math, it's easy to slip up.

First part: 3 + 5 is definitely 8. 

Second part: 12 - 3 + 4. Since subtraction and addition are left associative, so 12-3 is 9, then +4 gives 13. That's correct. 

Multiplying 8 and 13: 8*10=80, 8*3=24, so 80+24=104. Yep, that's right.

Adding the 10: 104 + 10 is 114, no problem.

Then 114 * 2: 100*2=200, 14*2=28, so total is 228. That seems correct.

Alternatively, maybe I can do 114*2 step by step: 100*2 is 200, 14*2 is 28. 200 + 28 = 228. Yep, that's the same.

Wait, just to be thorough, let me check if I interpreted the parentheses correctly. The original expression was [(3 + 5) x (12 - 3 + 4) + 10] * 2. So the multiplication is between the two parentheses (3+5) and (12-3+4), then add 10, then multiply by 2. That seems right. 

Alternatively, maybe someone might misinterpret the parentheses, but no, the structure is [(A) x (B) + C] * D, where A is 3+5, B is 12-3+4, C is 10, and D is 2. So the order of operations is correct as I applied. 

Alternatively, if someone does the operations in a different order, but according to PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication/Division, Addition/Subtraction), parentheses first, then within the parentheses, do the multiplication before addition. 

Wait, actually, let me check again the inner expression: [(3 +5) x (12 -3 +4) +10]. Once inside the outer brackets, you first compute the inner parentheses (3+5) and (12-3+4), then multiply those two results, then add 10, then multiply everything by 2. That all follows order of operations correctly. 

Alternatively, if someone did the addition before multiplication inside the brackets, but no, multiplication comes before addition. 

So, all steps seem correct. Therefore, the answer should be 228. 

Hmm, just to be 100% sure, maybe I can compute the entire expression step by step again:

Starting over:

Original expression: [(3 + 5) × (12 - 3 + 4) + 10] × 2

First, compute the expressions inside the innermost parentheses:

1. 3 + 5 = 8

2. 12 - 3 + 4: Let's compute left to right. 12 - 3 = 9; 9 + 4 =13.

Now substitute back into the expression:

[ (8) × (13) + 10 ] × 2

Now, inside the brackets, perform multiplication before addition:

8 ×13 = 104

Then add 10: 104 +10 = 114

Then multiply by 2: 114 ×2 = 228

Yes, that's consistent. 

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in 8×13? Let me check 13×8: 10×8=80 and 3×8=24; 80+24=104. Correct. 

Alternatively, maybe adding 12-3+4 incorrectly? Let's see: 12-3 is 9, then +4 gives 13. Yes, that's correct. 

Alternatively, if someone groups 12 - (3+4), but that would be 12 -7 =5, but since there's no parentheses around 3+4, it should be left to right. So 12-3 first. 

Therefore, all steps are correct. 

Therefore, the final answer should be 228. 

Wait, but let me compute 114*2 again. 100*2 is 200, 14*2 is 28, so total is 228. 

Alternatively, 114 + 114. 100+100 is 200, 14 +14 is 28, so 200 +28=228. Yep, that checks out. 

I think that's solid. I don't see any errors here. 

Therefore, the result is 228. 

**Final Answer**
The result is \boxed{228}.
</think>

To solve the expression \([(3 + 5) \times (12 - 3 + 4) + 10] \times 2\), we follow these steps:

1. Compute the innermost parentheses:
   - \(3 + 5 = 8\)
   - \(12 - 3 + 4\): 
     - \(12 - 3 = 9\)
     - \(9 + 4 = 13\)

2. Substitute these results back into the expression:
   \[
   [8 \times 13 + 10] \times 2
   \]

3. Perform the multiplication inside the brackets:
   - \(8 \times 13 = 104\)

4. Add 10 to the result:
   - \(104 + 10 = 114\)

5. Finally, multiply by 2:
   - \(114 \times 2 = 228\)

Thus, the final answer is \(\boxed{228}\).

## Case 2. `Second with Context`, `Raw question with full context`

* Response are smarter and very less costly 


Weather response with context: Here's the analysis of the weather alerts for Colorado:

1. **Widespread Fire Threat**: Multiple severe Red Flag Warnings are active across extensive areas of Colorado (including the Colorado River Basin, Routt, Gunnison Basin, and bordering regions of Utah), indicating extreme fire danger due to sustained southwest winds (10–25 mph with 35 mph gusts), critically low humidity (4–10%), and warm temperatures.  
2. **Timing & Impact**: All warnings are in effect from 1 PM to 8 PM MDT Monday, with conditions expected to cause fires to ignite easily, spread rapidly, and become difficult to control, requiring immediate caution for outdoor activities.  
3. **Broader Context**: The overlapping warnings across 9 fire weather zones emphasize the region’s vulnerability, as these conditions—driven by a combination of wind, aridity, and heat—are exceptional and pose a heightened risk of catastrophic wildfire behavior.

Math response: To solve the expression 
\([(3 + 5) \times (12 - 3 + 4) + 10] \times 2\), we break it down using the provided functions:

1. **Add 3 and 5**:
   \[

     \]
   - Then add 4:
     \[
     9 + 4 = 13 \quad \text{(using add(9, 4))}
     \]

3. **Multiply the results of the first two steps**:
   \[
   8 \times 13 = 104 \quad \text{(using multiple(8, 13))}
   \]

4. **Add 10 to the result**:
   \[
   104 + 10 = 114 \quad \text{(using add(104, 10))}
   \]

5. **Multiply by 2**:
